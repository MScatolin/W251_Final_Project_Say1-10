Possible Comercial uses:
  * Separating speech when multiple people are talking
  * Improve speech-to-text inference (particularly in in noisy environments)
  * Biometric security: digits recognition

Bibliographic Review
 * Visual units and confusion modelling for automatic lip-reading, June 2015. Dominic Howell, Stephen Cox, Barry Theobald
   * 2 datasets of 1 speaker. First only 211 single words (picked to be relevant). Second had 3000 sentences.
   * Use of weighted finite state transducer and phoneme based 
  
 * LIPNET: END-TO-END SENTENCE-LEVEL LIPREADING, December 2016. Yannis M. Assael, Brendan Shillingford, Shimon Whiteson, Nando de Freitas
   * First ANN based model that takes a sentence approach (other than songle words)
   * 95.2% on GRID corpus.
   
 * Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild, December 2017, Joon Son Chung, Andrew Senior, Oriol Vinyals, Andrew Zisserman
   * Limited corpus recognitiion using encoder-decoder architecture with attention.

 * Survey on automatic lip-reading in the era of deep learning, July 2018, Adriana Fernandez-Lopez, Federico M. Sukno. 
   * Survey on several papers on lip-reading using deep learning. Usefull to compare results.
  
 * LARGE-SCALE VISUAL SPEECH RECOGNITION, October 2018. Brendan Shillingford, Yannis Assael, Matthew W. Hoffman, Thomas Paine, CÃ­an Hughes, Utsav Prabhu, Hank Liao, Hasim Sak, Kanishka Rao, Lorrayne Bennett, Marie Mulville, Ben Coppin, Ben Laurie, Andrew Senior, Nando de Freitas
   * Largest database (3886 hours) with open sentence. They were able to achieve WER 40.9% using only video, halving the existing state of the art model.

 * datasets:
   * http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrw1.html
     * looks promissing, 500 words already classified with 800 to 1000 examples. Need to verifiy if digits are available. Need authorization for usage, which may not be taken in feasible time.
